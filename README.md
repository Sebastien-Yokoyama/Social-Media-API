# Generic Social Media API

This is a generic Social Media API Project to help me become familiar with setting up a RDBMS, database connectivity in a program, and web development APIs.
It will utilize SQLite for storing user data and message data and the JDBC API for database connectivity.
The web development framework (TBD) will be used to manage HTTP request and response bodies.
